# Euler-Path
Is a given graph Eulerian?  A graph G is called Eulerian if it is connected and the degree of    every vertex is an even number.  It is known that such graphs have a    cycle (not simple) that goes through every edge of the graph    exactly once.  A connected graph that has exactly 2 vertices of odd    degree has an Eulerian path.  Write a function that outputs one of    the messages that applies to the given graph.
