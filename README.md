# Euler-Path
Is a given graph Eulerian?  A graph G is called Eulerian if it is connected and the degree of every vertex is an even number.  It is known that such graphs have a cycle (not simple) that goes through every edge of the graph exactly once. A connected graph that has exactly 2 vertices of odd  degree has an Eulerian path. This project finds such path.

1. Edge.java, Graph.java, Vertex.java are support files for graph construction.

2. EulerianPath.java is the file that checks if the given graph is Eulerian or not.

3. Driver.java has the starter class that accepts input from console or Cmd line arguments
